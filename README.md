MNIST Classification Notebook:
Goes through some classical techniques for classification, K-nearest-neighbours and random forest. Tests are run on the applicability of different values for K number of neighbours leading to the following accuracy results:

Various dimensionality reduction techniques and which when tested with the optimal KNN results achieve these results:

The ideology and results are more clearly seen in the notebook so I reccomend you give it a look!
